This repository contains example implementations of Java and j2EE Design Patterns

## GoF - Java Design Patterns
### Creational
These patterns are used when we need to create new objects.

Sometimes object creation is not simple task. It could be complex process. In other words, it may involve may steps or may need more resources like time, memory or processing power. In such cases we can use Creational design patterns.

These design patterns deal with creation of classes or objects. Moreover, It helps to increase re-usability and flexibility of the code.

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

### Structural
Structural design patterns are used to design the class structure and architecture.

We can use these for creating new functionality or extending the existing functionality.

Many times we come across a scenario where we have incompatible objects.For instance, consider we have mobile and charger of different companies. As a result, we can not connect them because they are not compatible.

Likewise, assume that we have java code for MySQL database but we have Oracle database. In such cases we need to create some small project. This project will help both of them communicate. This solution can be called as Java Structural design pattern implementation.

* Adapter
  Provides the solution for helping incompatible things to communicate with each other
* Bridge
  Separates things so that they can work independently as well
* Composite
  Allows to operate objects in a tree structure hierarchy
* Decorator
  Allows to add new functionality to existing object
* Facade
  Provide the simple interface to use many small systems. Additionally, hides the complexity by wrapping the different process. We can use without knowing each process
* Flyweight
  Allows to reuse the object if available otherwise create new and store in memory
* Proxy
  Represents the functionality of other object. Protect original object from direct access to prevent damage

### Behavioral
